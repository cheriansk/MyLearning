## 🌐 .Net Aspire

Aspire provides tools, templates, and packages for building observable, production-ready distributed apps. At the center is the app model—a code-first, single source of truth that defines your app's services, resources, and connections.

Aspire gives you a unified toolchain: launch and debug your entire app locally with one command, then deploy anywhere—Kubernetes, the cloud, or your own servers—using the same composition.

Extensibility is a core focus. Aspire's APIs are designed so you can adapt the platform to your infrastructure, services, and workflows.
